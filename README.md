Upbit API Node.js playground for REST and WebSocket examples.

## Requirements

- nvm
- Node.js 22
- npm

## Setup

```bash
nvm use
npm install
```

## Scripts

```bash
npm run ticker
npm run ticker:ws
npm run triangles
npm run triangles:live
npm run engine
npm run dashboard
npm run baseline
npm run check
npm test
```

The default market is `KRW-BTC`. Override it with `UPBIT_MARKET`:

```bash
UPBIT_MARKET=KRW-ETH npm run ticker
UPBIT_MARKET=KRW-ETH npm run ticker:ws
```

These examples use Upbit public quotation APIs, so no API keys are required.

## Triangular Arbitrage Scanner

Run the read-only universe scanner:

```bash
npm run triangles
```

The scanner loads all Upbit markets dynamically, finds unique 3-asset triangles, builds canonical and reverse route variants for each enabled start asset in a triangle (`KRW`, `BTC`, `USDT` by default), fetches orderbook snapshots, and writes:

- `out/upbit-triangles.json`
- `out/upbit-canonical-cycles.json`
- `out/upbit-canonical-cycle-multipliers.csv`
- `out/upbit-canonical-cycle-multipliers.html`

By default, `netMultiplier` equals `grossMultiplier` because no fee is assumed. To include a taker fee:

```bash
UPBIT_TAKER_FEE_RATE=0.0005 npm run triangles
```

The scanner does not submit orders. Reverse rows are calculated from their own route and current bid/ask snapshots. Report metadata includes `reportSchemaVersion: 2` because cycle rows now include `startAsset`, `endAsset`, and `routeVariantId`.

## Live Dashboard

Start the combined localhost engine and dashboard:

```bash
npm run triangles:live
```

The server prints a URL like:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3099
```

Use `PORT` to choose another port:

```bash
PORT=4100 npm run triangles:live
```

The browser reads from the local Node.js server only. Upbit market discovery, observation depth-5 and validation depth-30 orderbook WebSocket subscriptions, multiplier calculation, depth-aware candidate validation, caching, latency metrics, and capture saving are handled server-side. Captures are saved under `out/captures/`.

Run the engine and dashboard as separate processes:

```bash
npm run engine
npm run dashboard
```

The engine owns exchange connections, orderbook stores, strategy evaluation, dry-run/real execution, private fill tracking, snapshots, and append-only logs. The dashboard serves static files, reads `out/runtime/latest-snapshot.json`, exposes log APIs, and only queues `Start`, `Pause`, and `Stop` commands for the engine.

Append-only NDJSON logs are written under `out/logs/`:

- `events.ndjson`
- `decisions.ndjson`
- `orders.ndjson`
- `fills.ndjson`
- `errors.ndjson`

Authenticated Upbit REST and private MyOrder WebSocket foundations are present. Real order creation is refused unless `liveTradingEnabled=true`, `Q_GAGARIN_ALLOW_LIVE_TRADING=true`, and the `REAL_GUARDED` readiness checklist passes. `DRY_RUN` uses the same execution-plan shape and writes simulated decision/order/fill events without calling Upbit order creation.

The Logs tab can filter append-only logs by mode, type, start asset, strategy, and cycle. It also exposes a dry-run report summary and JSON/CSV export through `/api/dry-run-report`. The Execution tab separates latest real-run orders/fills from dry-run logs and shows guard/cache/readiness status.

The default real execution mode is `LIMIT_IOC_AT_OBSERVED_BEST`: each leg submits an Upbit limit order with `time_in_force=ioc` at the validation orderbook's observed best ask/bid and uses the filled amount for the next leg. Optional `BEST_IOC` remains disabled unless `enabledExecutionModes` includes `BEST_IOC` and `executionPolicy.allowBestIoc=true`.

Selected Arbitrage Desk points include route, depth validation, strategy result, execution feasibility, fee/profit fields, and TimingTrace latency breakdowns. Browser render timing is measured for display only and is not part of engine execution.

## Baseline and Runtime Config

Runtime mode defaults live in `config/runtime.json`; live trading is disabled by default.

Record baseline dashboard metrics:

```bash
npm run baseline
```

Baseline JSON files are saved under `out/baseline/`. See `BASELINE.md` for current runtime assumptions and dashboard behavior.
